# A simple-to-use UI library for Roblox.
With features such as **script-based UI** and a simple copy and paste install.
I will try to maintain this project as much as I can, and you can find more help in our Discord server.

## Installing uniUI
I've tried to make it as easy as possible to install uniUI, it's as simple as making a new ModuleScript in ReplicatedStorage and calling it uniUI, and pasting in the code from [the latest release](latest.lua).
